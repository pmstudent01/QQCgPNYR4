## Authentication

### API Key Authentication

The VehicleServiceCollectionSdk API uses API keys as a form of authentication. An API key is a unique identifier used to authenticate a user, developer, or a program that is calling the API.

#### Setting the API key

When you initialize the SDK, you can set the API key as follows:

```ts
const sdk = new VehicleServiceCollectionSdk({ apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY' });
```

If you need to set or update the API key after initializing the SDK, you can use:

```ts
const sdk = new VehicleServiceCollectionSdk();
sdk.apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
```

## Setting a Custom Timeout

You can set a custom timeout for the SDK's HTTP requests as follows:

```ts
const vehicleServiceCollectionSdk = new VehicleServiceCollectionSdk({ timeoutMs: 10000 });
```

# Sample Usage

Below is a comprehensive example demonstrating how to authenticate and call a simple endpoint:

```ts
import { VehicleServiceCollectionSdk } from 'vehicle-service-collection-sdk';

(async () => {
  const vehicleServiceCollectionSdk = new VehicleServiceCollectionSdk({
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  });

  const data = await vehicleServiceCollectionSdk.vehicleServiceCollectionSdk.getAllVehicles();

  console.log(data);
})();
```
