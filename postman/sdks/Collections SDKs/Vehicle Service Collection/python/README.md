# Setup & Configuration

## Supported Language Versions

This SDK is compatible with the following versions: `Python >= 3.9`

## Installation

To get started with the SDK, we recommend installing using `pip`:

```bash
pip install vehicle_service_collection_sdk
```

If you are using Python 3, you can use `pip3` instead:

```bash
pip3 install vehicle_service_collection_sdk
```

## Disabling Redirects

By default, the SDK follows HTTP redirects (3xx responses) automatically. Pass
`follow_redirects=False` to get the redirect response back as-is instead:

```python
client = VehicleServiceCollectionSdk(follow_redirects=False)
```

This can also be changed later with `client.set_follow_redirects(False)`.

## Logging

The SDK is silent by default. Pass a standard library `logging.Logger` as `logger` to log
every outgoing request and its response (method, URL, status, and duration):

```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger("VehicleServiceCollectionSdk")
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
logger.addHandler(logging.StreamHandler())

client = VehicleServiceCollectionSdk(logger=logger)
```

This can also be changed later with `client.set_logging(logger)`.

`Authorization` and `Cookie` header values are always redacted in logged output, regardless
of the logger's own configuration.

## Authentication

### API Key Authentication

The VehicleServiceCollectionSdk API uses API keys as a form of authentication. An API key is a unique identifier used to authenticate a user, developer, or a program that is calling the API.

#### Setting the API key

When you initialize the SDK, you can set the API key as follows:

```py
VehicleServiceCollectionSdk(
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
    timeout=10
)
```

If you need to set or update the API key after initializing the SDK, you can use:

```py
sdk.set_api_key("YOUR_API_KEY")
```

## Setting a Custom Timeout

You can set a custom timeout for the SDK's HTTP requests as follows:

```py
from vehicle_service_collection_sdk import VehicleServiceCollectionSdk

sdk = VehicleServiceCollectionSdk(timeout=10)
```

# Sample Usage

Below is a comprehensive example demonstrating how to authenticate and call a simple endpoint:

```py
from vehicle_service_collection_sdk import VehicleServiceCollectionSdk, Environment

sdk = VehicleServiceCollectionSdk(
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
    base_url=Environment.DEFAULT.value,
    timeout=10
)

result = sdk.vehicle_service_collection_sdk.get_all_vehicles()

print(result)

```

# Async Usage

The SDK includes an Async Client for making asynchronous API requests. This is useful for applications that need non-blocking operations, like web servers or apps with a graphical user interface.

```py
import asyncio
from vehicle_service_collection_sdk import VehicleServiceCollectionSdkAsync, Environment
from vehicle_service_collection_sdk.models import CreateAVehicleRequest

sdk = VehicleServiceCollectionSdkAsync(
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
    base_url=Environment.DEFAULT.value,
    timeout=10
)


request_body = CreateAVehicleRequest(
    nick_name="The Lisa Marie",
    vin="4M2DV11W4RDJ53329",
    make="Mercury",
    model="Villager",
    year="1994",
    miles=159864
)

async def main():
  result = await sdk.vehicle_service_collection_sdk.create_a_vehicle(request_body=request_body)
  print(result)

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Services

The SDK provides various services to interact with the API.
